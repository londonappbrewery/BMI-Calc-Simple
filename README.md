# BMI-Calc-Simple
Create a BMI calculator using JavaScript functions. 

The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a way of estimating the amount of body fat. It's used in medicine to calculate risk of heart disease.

You can calculate it using the formula below, where weight divided by height squared.

Your challenge is to create a function that takes height and weight as inputs and gives the calculated BMI value as an output.

NOTE: You do not need to write any alerts or prompts. Your code should only contain the function. You do not need to call the function.
